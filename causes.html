            <h1>What are the causes of deforestation?</h1>
            <p>
                Deforestation can happen quickly, such as when a fire sweeps through the landscape or the forest is
                clear-cut to make way for an oil palm plantation. While deforestation appears to be declining in some
                countries, it remains disturbingly high in othersâ€”including Brazil and the Democratic Republic of the
                Congo.

                    Logging Activities

                    <p>
                        Cutting down trees for wood, called logging, is another major cause. This wood is used for
                        furniture, paper, and building materials. Even selective logging, where only certain trees are
                        cut, can hurt forests by weakening their ecosystems.

                    Fires
                    <p>
                        Forest fires, whether started by nature or people, can destroy trees, shrubs, and the top layer
                        of soil. Pollution from nearby factories or farms can also harm trees and plants, making it
                        harder for the forest to function properly.
