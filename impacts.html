            <h1>Impacts</h1>
            <p>
                Deforestation has a wide range of significant and interconnected impacts across environmental, social.
            </p>
             
            <h2>Environmental Impacts:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Forests are like homes for most of the different kinds of plants and animals in the world. When
                        people cut down forests, the animals and plants lose their homes. This also breaks the big
                        forest into smaller pieces. Because they lose their homes, many kinds of animals and plants are
                        in danger and could disappear forever. People think that we lose many different kinds of animals
                        and plants every day because of cutting down forests.

            <h2>Social Impacts:</h2>
            <ul>

                <li> <p>
                When forests are gone, many people lose their way to make a living. Think about people who sell wood or
                things they find in the forest. They might not have jobs anymore if there are no trees. Forests also
                help us in other ways, like giving us clean water and good soil for growing food. If the forests
                disappear, it can be harder to get these things. So, when deforestation happens, people can become
                poorer and might not have enough food to eat.
